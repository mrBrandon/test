As such, they are able to put out a more dangerous volley of fire, but suffer from the longer reload of the Tanegashima over other modern musketry. Like other ranged cavalry available to the Bakemono, the Mounted Tanegashima lacks the full sized O Dachi and has difficulty defending itself in melee, thus relying on its size and constitution to outlast the enemy."

descr "While most Bakemono Sho are bullied into fighting and dying by the Dai Bakemono, the Bomb Throwers have it worse than others. Bomb Throwers are made to approach the front line unarmored and barely armed save for a sling that is used to throw ceramic or glass orbs filled with gunpowder. Bomb Throwers are liked by the Dai Bakemono for their ability to do significant damage to the enemy, particularly those vulnerable to fire, but must be replaced rather frequently due to their low survivability and tendency to blow themselves up. Sometimes, a Bomb Thrower survives long enough to obtain the armor of one of its compatriots. This doesn't really improve its odds of survival any, but the now-armored Bomb Thrower can at least feel more important."

descr "An oddity that defies explanation, the Bakemono Sho General is a Bakemono Sho that has somehow managed to gather enough personal power - without the aid of any magical ability, mind - to lead other Bakemono Sho and even Dai Bakemono. Even though they - in typical Bakemono Sho fashion - lead from the rear, Bakemono Sho Generals have a tendency to die horribly. Some suggest that these generals are pawns of Bakemono Shamans looking to extend their influence, but those who do always seem to die under mysterious circumstances."

Instead, their Mangonels are loaded with large clay pots filled with gunpowder. Any reports that the effect of large explosions in the midst of infantry are more effective than large rocks landing in infantry are the ravings of heretics and madmen."

The body was cast from molten stone bound with steel in a huge mold carved into the cave wall. Once nearly cooled a worker was carried with ceromony up to the chest of the construct and was pushed through the hardening stone by a runesmith. Not long after the whole mountain shook as the construct came to life. The journal cuts off here and neither the scholar or his remains have be found."
